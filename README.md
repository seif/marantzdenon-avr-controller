# Marantz and Denon AVR controller

A Gnome Shell extension to control a Denon AVR receiver through local network.

This is a fork of the extension [Denon AVR Controller](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2371/denon-avr-controller/) with added support for newer Denon API. You can switch in the extension settings between the old and new API, if one doesn't work try the other. I'm told some marantz devices use same API as denon, try it out and let me know in comments if your device is supported.
